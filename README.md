# Using Graph Databases for Event Data

## Description
This repository collects queries for modeling, importing, and analyzing event data as Knowledge Graphs using the Labeled Property Graph data model of graph databases. All scripts and queries are licensed under LGPL v3.0, see LICENSE. Copyright information is provided within each Project.

## Projects
The following projects are part of this repository


### [csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j](./csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j)
Data model and generic query templates for importing, integrating, and transforming a set of related CSV event logs into single event knowledge graph (EKG), stored as labeled property graph in [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/). See [csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j/README.txt](csv_to_eventgraph_neo4j/README.txt)
